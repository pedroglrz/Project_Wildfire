Authors: Pedro Galarza, Jack Epstein, Sara Price, and Kieran Sim

Collaborative Final Project for "Intro to Data Science" during the first semester of NYU's data science masters program.

All the work presented in the repository is code I contributed to the project and does not contain the entirety of the project. My contributions were mostly in these catagories:

  - Domain research
  - Climate/Weather Data Collection and Processing
  - Cross-validation parameter tuning
  - Model variance analysis
  - Learning-curve analysis
